# Flow: User Journey (Smart-Link to Conversion)

1. **Entry Point** – User lands via smart‑link (clicked from creator's content/social).

2. **Landing Page Render** – Page displays:
   * Product details & merchant branding
   * "Get ₹X back" banner (calculated from campaign share_pct)
   * Clear CTA: "Claim Reward & Shop"

3. **Reward Claim Flow**:
   * User clicks "Claim Reward" 
   * OTP modal appears requesting phone number
   * System calls `/v1/auth/otp/request`
   * User enters OTP code
   * System calls `/v1/auth/otp/verify` → returns JWT

4. **Redirect to Merchant**:
   * Page auto‑redirects to merchant (deep‑link if mobile)
   * Background beacon posts to `/v1/events/click` with link_id & user_id
   * Thank‑you toast: "Continue shopping; we'll message you when cashback is confirmed"

5. **Purchase & Conversion**:
   * User completes purchase on merchant site
   * Trackier fires postback to `/v1/events/conversion`
   * System processes conversion and creates ledger entry

6. **Reward Confirmation**:
   * After cool‑off period (30 days default)
   * Payout job runs, sends Amazon GV code via SMS/email
   * User receives voucher code

**Success Metrics**:
* Click‑to‑redirect rate ≥ 80%
