# Test: Creator Dashboard – Mobile Breakpoint

## Scenario: Overview tab renders core KPIs on 375 px width
*Given* JWT with `role=creator`
*When* viewport is set to 375 × 812 and `/overview` is loaded
*Then* the KPI cards "Clicks", "Conversions", and "Pending payout" must all be present
*And* "Create Campaign" FAB is visible
*And* no horizontal scrollbar exists.

## Scenario: Navigation switches to bottom bar
*Given* viewport 375 × 812
*When* landing on `/overview`
*Then* a bottom navigation bar with 4 icons (Overview, Campaigns, Payouts, Settings) is present.

## Scenario: Campaigns table collapses gracefully
*Given* viewport 375 × 812
*When* `/campaigns` tab is loaded
*Then* at least the columns "Campaign" and "Status" are visible without horizontal scroll.
