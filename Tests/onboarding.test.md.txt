# Test: Creator Onboarding

## Scenario: Successful sign‑up
*Given* valid details & OTP  
*When* user completes onboarding.flow  
*Then* JSON store `tenants` contains exactly one new object with keys `tenant_id`, `pid`, `default_share_pct`.  
*And* event `creator.onboarded` is emitted.

## Scenario: Duplicate phone
*Given* phone already exists  
*When* OTP verified  
*Then* flow aborts with message “Account already exists” and no new tenant is created.
